# Overview

Hello, I have become interested in investing in stocks and am trying to figure out the best was to analys them. This a stock analysis program I wrote with the idea of learning more about stocks.

I downloaded the following dataset from Kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yash612/stockmarket-sentiment-dataset. I chose this one because it was rated a 10 for useability and had been used a learning dataset by several people before me. I wanted to read a csv file into a pandas spreadsheet. From there I wanted to see if I could get information out of the data that would be useable and help me better understand what to expect when investing in the stock market.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results
1) What it the average closing price each year for each dataset.
   The graph shows the which years had higher averages.
2) How trading volume changed over time.
   The graph shows how active the market was every year.
3) How volatile the market is each year.
   The graph shows the price swings each year.       

# Development Environment
I wrote the program in Visual Studio code. It is the development enviroment I am most familure with. I did us command prompts, and created new Paths on my computer in an attempt to create an independant development enviroment. In the end using Visuel Studio Code was one less thing to figure out.

I used:
 1) I wrote the script in Python. Python is a versatile and frequently used programming language. It has many free libries and resources.  
 2) Kraggle.com to find a free dataset to do stock analysis with.
 3) Pandas as pd which is used in Python. It is a programmable spreadsheet to drop the data into. I created a numeric spreadsheet of columns of data which I then use to extract the data per year. The data was listed by date in a way that would not allow me to get year totals. I altered the spreadsheet to extract the year and break up the data by year. 
 4) Matplotlib is a graphing plotting library used in Python to make graphs. It makes it easier to visualize the data

# Future Work
* Using the index info set which has region and currancy.
* Creat a csv to put the results in. 
* Add a print feature that writes the answers in addition to the graphs.
